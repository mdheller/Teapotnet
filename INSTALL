== Teapotnet - Installation notes ==


You can compile the program with a simple:
$ make

This should work for any more or less POSIX-compliant system.

You can then run the application:
$ ./teapotnet

Or with the local tracker enabled:
$ ./teapotnet --tracker

Once the program is running, point your web browser to http://localhost:8480/
to access the interface.

Alternatively, you can install it:
# make install

Or with another prefix (default prefix is /usr/local):
# make install prefix=/usr

By default, it listens for TPOT connections on UDP or TCP port 8080.
The HTTP interface listens on port 8480, and the tracker on port 8488.
This can be changed in config.txt (created at first startup)
