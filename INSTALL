* TeapotNet - Installation notes

Installing is not supported for the moment.

You can compile the executable by simply doing:
$ make

This should work for any more or less POSIX-compliant system.

You can then run the application with the tracker:
$ ./teapotnet --tracker

or without it:
$ ./teapotnet

By default, it listens for TPOT connections on port 8480.
The interface listen by defaut on port 8080, and the tracker on port 8488.
