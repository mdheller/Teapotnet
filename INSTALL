== Teapotnet - Installation notes ==


You can compile the program with a simple:
$ make

This should work for any more or less POSIX-compliant system.

You can then run the application:
$ ./teapotnet

Or with the local tracker enabled:
$ ./teapotnet --tracker

Once the program is running, point your web browser to http://localhost:8480/
to access the interface.

Alternatively, you can install it:
# make install

Or with another prefix (default prefix is /usr/local):
# make install prefix=/usr

By default, it listens for TPOT connections on port 8080.
The interface listens by defaut on port 8480, and the tracker on port 80.
This can be changed in config.txt (created at first startup)

You can create a new user directly from the interface.
Alternatively, write the username and password to users.txt
(deleted during startup) before launching the program, as follow:
$ echo myusername mypassword > users.txt
$ ./teapotnet

Note directories.txt (created at first startup) contains global shared directories
(ie for all users of the program).
The format is "name=path" on each line (for instance "test=/home/test").
