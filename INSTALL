== TeapotNet - Installation notes ==
      by Paul-Louis Ageneau


Installing is not supported for the moment.

You can compile the program with a simple:
$ make

This should work for any more or less POSIX-compliant system.
Note you need libpthread for the compilation to succeed.

You can then run the application with the tracker:
$ ./teapotnet --tracker

or without it:
$ ./teapotnet

By default, it listens for TPOT connections on port 8480.
The interface listens by defaut on port 8080, and the tracker on port 8488.
This can be changed in config.txt (created at first startup)

To create a new user, write the username and password to users.txt
(emptied during startup) as follow:
$ echo myusername mypassword > users.txt
$ ./teapotnet

Once the program is running, point your web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080/
to access the interface.

Note directories.txt contains global shared directories (ie for all users)
The format is "name=path" (for instance "test=/home/test") on each line.
